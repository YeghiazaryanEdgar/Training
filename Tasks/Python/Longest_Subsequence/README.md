Exercise:
   Given a string S and a set of words D, find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.
   For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple","bale", "kangaroo"} the  
   correct output would be "apple" 

Example: 
   ./longest_subsequence.py 'abppplee' -l 'able' 'ale' 'apple' 'bale' 'kangaroo'

How to run? 
   Run longest_subsequence.py file passing a string and a list arguments to it like the ones in example.

longest_subsequence_test.py contains some test methods.
   In order to run it type ./longest_subsequence_test.py in command line.
